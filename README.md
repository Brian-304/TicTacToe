# Title: Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where players take turns marking an X or O on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for a winner when a player has three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or declares a tie if the grid is full with no winner.

## Functionality:
1. What the Application Does:
   - The game allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe on a 3x3 grid. It alternates turns between players, checks for winning conditions after each move, and ends the game when thereâ€™s a winner or a tie.
2. User Inputs:
   - Each player inputs their desired grid position (1-9) during their turn.
3. Target Audience:
   - Casual gamers of all ages, especially those who enjoy quick, simple games.

## Known Issues (Work in progress)
This project is still ongoing. The project does't not restart after game ends. It also does not have any statistics for tracking how many times a player has won and number of draws. Also, invalid inputs (Name is invalid if not a character, or out of bounds) are handled.
